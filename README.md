# Ansible-Terraform-Lab


This project aims to enhance proficiency in Infrastructure as Code by utilizing two powerful tools: Terraform and Ansible. The project comprises two distinct parts, each utilizing one of the tools.

The first part of the project will focus on setting up a mini-infrastructure on Azure using Terraform. I plan to leverage my Azure Student subscription to create several VMs connected in a network. The objective is to create a network of Linux VMs that can communicate with each other through the network. the main.tf file can successfully create three Azure VMs linked in a network, as depicted below:

Upcoming tasks involve generating SSH keys and assigning public IP addresses to each VM.

The second part of the project involves applying Ansible playbooks to the mini-infrastructure created using Terraform. By doing so, we aim to streamline the infrastructure management process, improving scalability, reliability, and security.

Stay tuned for further updates on this exciting project.
